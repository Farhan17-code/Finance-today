                <h2>Ancient Finance (3000 BCE - 500 CE)</h2>
                <p>The story of finance begins in ancient Mesopotamia around 3000 BCE. The Sumerians developed the first known system of credit and debt using clay tablets to record transactions.</p>
                <div class="timeline"><strong>Key Development:</strong> The Code of Hammurabi (1750 BCE) established rules for loans, interest rates (capped at 33% for grain, 20% for silver), and debt forgiveness.</div>
                <p>Ancient temples functioned as the first banks, storing grain and precious metals. They made loans to farmers and merchants, charging interest. This was revolutionary—money could now generate more money through lending.</p>
                <p>The Lydians (modern-day Turkey) minted the first standardized coins around 600 BCE, transforming trade. No longer did merchants need to weigh and verify metal purity for each transaction.</p>
                <p>Ancient Rome advanced banking significantly, with argentarii (bankers) offering deposits, loans, currency exchange, and even primitive checks called praescriptiones.</p>
            </div>
            
            <div class="era-section">
                <h2>Medieval Banking (500 - 1500 CE)</h2>
                <p>After Rome's fall, the Catholic Church dominated European finance. Initially, charging interest (usury) was forbidden as sinful, which limited banking development.</p>
                <div class="timeline"><strong>Innovation:</strong> Italian merchant families developed creative solutions, charging "fees" instead of interest, and bills of exchange to transfer money without physical transport.</div>
                <p>The Knights Templar created an early international banking network during the Crusades. Pilgrims could deposit money in Europe and withdraw it in the Holy Land using encrypted letters of credit—a revolutionary concept.</p>
                <p>The Medici family of Florence became Europe's most powerful bankers in the 15th century, financing kings and popes. They invented double-entry bookkeeping, a system still used today.</p>
                <p>The first stock exchange emerged in Bruges (Belgium) around 1309, where traders met to exchange promissory notes and government securities.</p>

            <div class="era-section">
                <h2>The Birth of Modern Banking (1500 - 1800)</h2>
                <p>The Age of Exploration created demand for capital to finance expensive voyages. Joint-stock companies emerged, allowing multiple investors to share risks and profits.</p>
                <div class="timeline"><strong>Milestone:</strong> The Dutch East India Company (1602) issued the first shares on the Amsterdam Stock Exchange, creating the world's first publicly traded company.</div>
                <p>The Bank of England, founded in 1694, established the model for modern central banking. It was created to fund England's war with France and introduced the revolutionary idea of government-backed paper money.</p>
                <p>This era saw the first major financial bubbles and crashes. The South Sea Bubble (1720) and Mississippi Bubble (1720) showed how speculation and fraud could devastate economies—lessons that would be repeatedly forgotten and relearned.</p>
            </div>
            
            <div class="era-section">
                <h2>Industrial Revolution Finance (1800 - 1900)</h2>
                <p>The Industrial Revolution demanded massive capital for factories, railroads, and infrastructure. Investment banking emerged to connect investors with businesses needing funds.</p>
                <p>Families like the Rothschilds built international banking empires, financing governments and major industrial projects across Europe. They pioneered international bond markets and rapid communication networks.</p>
                <div class="timeline"><strong>Innovation:</strong> The telegraph (1840s) revolutionized finance by enabling near-instant communication of prices and news, creating truly interconnected markets.</div>
                <p>Stock exchanges proliferated globally. The NYSE became increasingly dominant, with railroad stocks driving massive speculation and wealth creation. The concept of "market manipulation" was barely understood, let alone illegal.</p>
                <p>This era established limited liability corporations, allowing investors to risk only their investment rather than personal assets—critical for attracting capital to risky ventures.</p>

                <h2>20th Century Transformation (1900 - 2000)</h2>
                <p>The 20th century saw finance evolve from local to global, from simple to complex, from unregulated to heavily supervised.</p>
                <p><strong>The Great Depression Era:</strong> The 1929 crash led to fundamental reforms. The Glass-Steagall Act (1933) separated commercial and investment banking. The SEC was created to regulate securities markets. Deposit insurance protected savers.</p>
                <div class="timeline"><strong>Bretton Woods (1944):</strong> Established the post-WWII financial order, fixing currencies to the dollar and the dollar to gold. Created the IMF and World Bank to stabilize the global economy.</div>
                <p><strong>The Computer Revolution:</strong> Electronic trading began in the 1970s, gradually replacing floor trading. By the 1990s, online trading democratized market access, allowing individuals to trade from home.</p>
                <p><strong>Derivatives Explosion:</strong> Financial engineering created complex instruments like options, futures, swaps, and mortgage-backed securities. These allowed sophisticated risk management but also enabled spectacular failures.</p>
                <p><strong>Globalization:</strong> Capital flows became truly global. A crisis in Thailand could trigger worldwide panic. Financial institutions became enormous, operating across borders with minimal oversight.</p>
            </div>
            
            <div class="era-section">
                <h2>21st Century Finance (2000 - Present)</h2>
                <p>The 2008 financial crisis revealed dangerous vulnerabilities in the global financial system, triggering the worst downturn since the Great Depression.</p>
                <div class="timeline"><strong>Post-Crisis Reforms:</strong> Dodd-Frank Act (2010) increased regulation. Basel III imposed stricter capital requirements on banks. "Too big to fail" became a central policy concern.</div>
                <p><strong>Fintech Revolution:</strong> Technology companies disrupted traditional banking. Mobile payments, peer-to-peer lending, robo-advisors, and crowdfunding challenged established institutions.</p>
                <p><strong>Cryptocurrency:</strong> Bitcoin (2009) introduced decentralized digital currency. Blockchain technology promised to revolutionize everything from payments to contracts. By 2021, crypto's total market value exceeded $2 trillion.</p>
                <p><strong>Central Bank Innovation:</strong> Near-zero and negative interest rates became policy tools. Quantitative easing (buying assets to inject money) became standard. Central bank digital currencies are now being developed globally.</p>
                <p><strong>ESG and Impact Investing:</strong> Environmental, social, and governance factors became mainstream investment considerations, with trillions flowing into sustainable investments.</p>

                <h2>Key Lessons from Financial History</h2>
                <p>Despite millennia of evolution, certain patterns repeat throughout financial history:</p>
                <p><strong>1. Bubbles and Crashes Are Inevitable:</strong> From tulip mania to dot-com to housing, every generation experiences speculative excess followed by painful correction.</p>
                <p><strong>2. Innovation Brings Risk:</strong> New financial instruments always promise better risk management but often create new, unforeseen dangers.</p>
                <p><strong>3. Regulation Lags Innovation:</strong> Financial creativity consistently outpaces regulatory capacity, requiring constant adaptation.</p>
                <p><strong>4. Interconnection Amplifies Shocks:</strong> As finance globalizes, local problems become worldwide crises faster.</p>
                <p><strong>5. Trust Is Fundamental:</strong> Finance depends on confidence. Once trust evaporates, systems collapse regardless of underlying fundamentals.</p>
