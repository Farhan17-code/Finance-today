        <div class="main-content">
            <p style="font-size: 1.2rem; margin-bottom: 2rem;">Financial scams cost consumers billions annually. Scammers constantly evolve their tactics, but the fundamentals remain the same: creating urgency, exploiting trust, and promising unrealistic returns. Here's what to watch for.</p>
            
            <div class="scam-section">
                <h2>1. Phishing and Identity Theft</h2>
                <p>Fraudsters impersonate banks, government agencies, or legitimate companies to steal personal information like passwords, social security numbers, and account details.</p>
                <div class="warning">
                    <strong>Common Tactics:</strong> Emails claiming your account is compromised, fake IRS notices demanding payment, texts about package delivery requiring personal info, calls from "tech support" about computer viruses.
                </div>
                <p>These scammers create urgency, claiming you must act immediately or face consequences. They use official-looking logos and language to appear legitimate.</p>
                <div class="tip">
                    <strong>Protection:</strong> Never click links in unsolicited emails. Call companies directly using numbers from official websites. Government agencies don't demand immediate payment via gift cards or wire transfers. Enable two-factor authentication everywhere.
                </div>
            </div>
            
            <div class="scam-section">
                <h2>2. Investment Fraud</h2>
                <p>Scammers promise guaranteed high returns with little or no risk. They may use fake credentials, fabricated performance records, or pressure tactics to convince victims to invest.</p>
                <p><strong>Common Types:</strong> Ponzi schemes, pyramid schemes, advance-fee fraud, affinity fraud (targeting religious/ethnic groups), offshore investing scams.</p>
                <div class="warning">
                    <strong>Red Flags:</strong> Guaranteed returns, overly consistent returns regardless of market conditions, unregistered investments, unlicensed sellers, difficulty receiving payments, pressure to recruit others.
                </div>
                <p>Bernie Madoff ran a $65 billion Ponzi scheme for decades by showing consistent fake returns and creating an aura of exclusivity.</p>
                <div class="tip">
                    <strong>Protection:</strong> Verify advisors through FINRA BrokerCheck. Question any investment promising returns above market averages. Understand what you're investing in. Get everything in writing. Be skeptical of exclusivity.
                </div>
            </div>

            <div class="scam-section">
                <h2>3. Credit Repair Scams</h2>
                <p>Companies claim they can quickly fix bad credit or remove negative information from credit reports for upfront fees. In reality, no one can legally remove accurate negative information.</p>
                <div class="warning">
                    <strong>Red Flags:</strong> Guarantees to remove negative information, requests for payment before services, advice to dispute all information on your credit report, suggestions to create a new credit identity.
                </div>
                <p>These scams often charge hundreds or thousands of dollars for tasks you can do yourself for free, like disputing errors with credit bureaus.</p>
                <div class="tip">
                    <strong>Protection:</strong> Check credit reports yourself at AnnualCreditReport.com (free). Dispute errors directly with credit bureaus. Be patient—legitimate credit repair takes time. Avoid companies demanding upfront payment.
                </div>
            </div>
            
            <div class="scam-section">
                <h2>4. Advance Fee Scams</h2>
                <p>Victims are promised something valuable (loans, grants, prizes, jobs) but must first pay fees, taxes, or processing costs. After payment, the promised item never materializes.</p>
                <p><strong>Variations:</strong> "Nigerian prince" emails, lottery winnings requiring tax payment, guaranteed loan approval after upfront fee, mystery shopper jobs requiring deposits.</p>
                <div class="warning">
                    <strong>Red Flags:</strong> Unsolicited offers of money or opportunities, requests for upfront payment, pressure to act quickly, poor grammar or spelling, requests for payment via gift cards or wire transfer.
                </div>
                <div class="tip">
                    <strong>Protection:</strong> Legitimate lenders don't guarantee approval before seeing your application. Real prizes don't require payment. If you didn't enter a lottery, you didn't win. Never pay fees to receive money.
                </div>

            <div class="scam-section">
                <h2>5. Grandparent/Emergency Scams</h2>
                <p>Scammers call elderly victims claiming to be grandchildren or family members in urgent trouble, needing money immediately for bail, hospital bills, or emergencies.</p>
                <div class="warning">
                    <strong>Red Flags:</strong> Calls from unknown numbers claiming emergency, requests not to tell other family members, demands for immediate wire transfer or gift cards, refusal to verify identity through other means.
                </div>
                <p>These scams exploit emotions and create panic, preventing rational thinking. Scammers gather information from social media to make stories believable.</p>
                <div class="tip">
                    <strong>Protection:</strong> Hang up and call the family member directly. Verify the story with other relatives. Never send money without confirmation. Establish a family code word for real emergencies.
                </div>
            </div>
            
            <div class="scam-section">
                <h2>6. Tech Support Scams</h2>
                <p>Fraudsters claim to be from well-known tech companies, warning of computer viruses or security issues. They gain remote access to computers and steal information or demand payment for fake fixes.</p>
                <div class="warning">
                    <strong>Red Flags:</strong> Unsolicited calls about computer problems, pop-ups claiming viruses detected, requests for remote computer access, demands for payment via gift cards, aggressive or threatening language.
                </div>
                <p>Microsoft, Apple, and other tech companies never initiate unsolicited calls about computer problems. Pop-ups can be fake—your browser may not actually detect threats.</p>
                <div class="tip">
                    <strong>Protection:</strong> Never give remote access to unsolicited callers. Close browser tabs showing fake virus warnings. Use legitimate antivirus software. If concerned about computer security, contact companies directly through official channels.
                </div>
            </div>

            <div class="scam-section">
                <h2>7. Debt Collection Scams</h2>
                <p>Fake debt collectors harass people about debts they don't owe, using threats of arrest, lawsuits, or credit damage to extort payments.</p>
                <div class="warning">
                    <strong>Red Flags:</strong> Threatening arrest or violence, refusing to provide written validation, demanding immediate payment via wire transfer or gift cards, calling repeatedly or at odd hours, claiming you owe debts you don't recognize.
                </div>
                <p>Real debt collectors must follow strict rules under the Fair Debt Collection Practices Act, including providing written validation and respecting reasonable boundaries.</p>
                <div class="tip">
                    <strong>Protection:</strong> Request debt validation in writing. Never pay without verification. Know your rights under FDCPA. Report aggressive collectors to FTC. Verify the debt exists through credit reports.
                </div>
            </div>
            
            <div class="scam-section">
                <h2>8. Charity Scams</h2>
                <p>Fraudsters exploit generosity, especially after disasters, creating fake charities or impersonating legitimate ones to collect donations they pocket.</p>
                <div class="warning">
                    <strong>Red Flags:</strong> Pressure for immediate donations, vague descriptions of how funds are used, requests for cash or wire transfers, refusal to provide documentation, names similar to well-known charities.
                </div>
                <p>Disaster relief efforts attract scammers who create websites and social media campaigns that look legitimate but funnel donations into personal accounts.</p>
                <div class="tip">
                    <strong>Protection:</strong> Research charities through Charity Navigator or GuideStar. Donate directly through official charity websites. Never give to solicitors demanding immediate payment. Check tax-exempt status with IRS.
                </div>
            </div>
            
            <div class="scam-section">
                <h2>9. Employment Scams</h2>
                <p>Fake employers post job listings to steal personal information or money. They may offer work-from-home opportunities requiring upfront investments in equipment or training.</p>
                <div class="warning">
                    <strong>Red Flags:</strong> Jobs requiring payment for training or equipment, vague job descriptions, promises of high pay for minimal work, interviews conducted only via text/email, requests for personal info before interview, checks to deposit and wire back money.
                </div>
                <p>Reshipping scams involve "jobs" receiving packages and reshipping them—you're unknowingly facilitating theft and can face legal consequences.</p>
                <div class="tip">
                    <strong>Protection:</strong> Research companies thoroughly. Real employers don't require payment. Be suspicious of overly generous compensation. Never deposit checks and wire money back. Verify jobs through company websites directly.
                </div>
            </div>

            <div class="scam-section">
                <h2>10. Romance Scams</h2>
                <p>Scammers create fake online profiles to develop romantic relationships, eventually asking for money for emergencies, travel, or investments.</p>
                <div class="warning">
                    <strong>Red Flags:</strong> Professing love quickly, refusing video calls, always having emergencies requiring money, claiming to be overseas (military, oil rig worker), moving conversations off dating platforms immediately.
                </div>
                <p>Romance scams cause emotional and financial devastation. Victims lose an average of $2,500, though some lose their entire life savings.</p>
                <div class="tip">
                    <strong>Protection:</strong> Never send money to someone you haven't met in person. Do reverse image searches on profile photos. Be skeptical of sob stories. Take relationships slowly. Trust your instincts.

                <h2 style="color: #10b981; margin-bottom: 1rem;">Universal Protection Strategies</h2>
                <ul style="margin-left: 2rem; line-height: 2;">
                    <li>Trust your instincts—if something feels wrong, it probably is</li>
                    <li>Take time to think—scammers create artificial urgency</li>
                    <li>Verify independently—don't trust information provided by the potential scammer</li>
                    <li>Protect personal information—never share unnecessarily</li>
                    <li>Use credit cards over debit cards—better fraud protection</li>
                    <li>Monitor financial accounts regularly for unauthorized charges</li>
                    <li>Report scams to FTC, FBI IC3, and local authorities</li>
                    <li>Educate vulnerable family members about common scams</li>
