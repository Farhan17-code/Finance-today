                <h2>1. Warren Buffett</h2>
                <div class="icon-subtitle">"The Oracle of Omaha"</div>
                <p>One of the most successful investors of all time, Warren Buffett's story begins in Omaha, Nebraska, where he developed a passion for business and investing as a child.</p>
                <div class="struggle-box">
                    <strong>The Struggle:</strong> Rejected by Harvard Business School, Buffett attended Columbia instead, where he studied under Benjamin Graham. Early in his career, he worked as a stockbroker earning just $12,000 annually. His initial investment partnerships were small, and convincing investors to trust his unconventional long-term strategy was challenging.
                </div>
                <p>Buffett persevered with his value investing philosophy, even when it seemed outdated. He lived frugally in the same modest Omaha house he bought in 1958 for $31,500, reinvesting profits instead of splurging on luxuries.</p>
                <div class="quote">"The stock market is designed to transfer money from the Active to the Patient."</div>
                <p><strong>Legacy:</strong> Built Berkshire Hathaway into a $700+ billion conglomerate. Known for incredible discipline and staying true to his principles even during market manias.</p>
            </div>
            
            <div class="icon-item">
                <h2>2. Oprah Winfrey</h2>
                <div class="icon-subtitle">"From Poverty to Billionaire Media Mogul"</div>
                <p>Born into poverty in rural Mississippi, Oprah faced abuse, discrimination, and numerous setbacks. She became pregnant at 14 and lost the baby shortly after birth.</p>
                <div class="struggle-box">
                    <strong>The Struggle:</strong> Fired from her first television job as a news anchor for being "too emotionally invested" in stories. Faced racism and sexism in the male-dominated media industry. Struggled with weight issues publicly scrutinized by millions.
                </div>
                <p>Despite these challenges, Oprah transformed her perceived weakness (emotional connection) into her greatest strength. She created a new format of television that emphasized empathy and authenticity.</p>
                <div class="quote">"Turn your wounds into wisdom."</div>
                <p><strong>Legacy:</strong> First Black female billionaire. Built a media empire including television, publishing, and production. Her financial acumen turned The Oprah Winfrey Show into a billion-dollar brand.</p>
            </div>

            <div class="icon-item">
                <h2>3. Ray Dalio</h2>
                <div class="icon-subtitle">"Principles-Based Investing Pioneer"</div>
                <p>Founder of Bridgewater Associates, the world's largest hedge fund. Dalio started his firm from his apartment in 1975.</p>
                <div class="struggle-box">
                    <strong>The Struggle:</strong> In 1982, Dalio predicted an economic depression and made large bets accordingly. He was spectacularly wrong. His fund lost so much money he had to lay off everyone and borrow $4,000 from his father to survive. He was humiliated and nearly bankrupt.
                </div>
                <p>This devastating failure taught Dalio the importance of radical truth-seeking and systematic decision-making. He developed algorithmic investment strategies and a unique corporate culture based on "radical transparency."</p>
                <div class="quote">"Pain plus reflection equals progress."</div>
                <p><strong>Legacy:</strong> Built Bridgewater to manage $160+ billion. His book "Principles" became a bestseller, sharing lessons from his biggest mistakes.</p>
            </div>
            
            <div class="icon-item">
                <h2>4. Sara Blakely</h2>
                <div class="icon-subtitle">"Self-Made Billionaire Entrepreneur"</div>
                <p>Creator of Spanx, Sara Blakely started with just $5,000 in savings and an idea for footless pantyhose.</p>
                <div class="struggle-box">
                    <strong>The Struggle:</strong> Worked as a door-to-door fax machine salesperson for seven years. Faced constant rejection from manufacturers who laughed at her idea. Rejected by every venture capitalist she approached. Had no background in fashion or business.
                </div>
                <p>Blakely persisted, learning patent law herself to save money, and convincing a hosiery mill owner (after his daughters tried the product) to manufacture her invention. She personally drove to stores to pitch her product.</p>
                <div class="quote">"Don't be intimidated by what you don't know. That can be your greatest strength."</div>
                <p><strong>Legacy:</strong> Became the youngest self-made female billionaire in America. Built Spanx without any outside investment, maintaining 100% ownership.</p>
            </div>
            
            <div class="icon-item">
                <h2>5. John Templeton</h2>
                <div class="icon-subtitle">"Pioneer of Global Investing"</div>
                <p>Founded the Templeton Growth Fund and became one of the first investors to recognize opportunities in foreign markets.</p>
                <div class="struggle-box">
                    <strong>The Struggle:</strong> Started investing in 1939 during the Great Depression by borrowing $10,000 to buy 100 shares each of 104 companies trading below $1. 34 of those companies were bankrupt. Friends and family thought he was insane. The financial establishment dismissed his ideas about investing in war-torn Europe and emerging markets.
                </div>
                <p>Templeton's contrarian approach—buying when others were panicking—proved incredibly profitable. His willingness to invest globally when others feared foreign markets revolutionized investing.</p>
                <div class="quote">"The time of maximum pessimism is the best time to buy."</div>
                <p><strong>Legacy:</strong> Achieved average annual returns over 15% for decades. Demonstrated that global diversification reduces risk and enhances returns.</p>
            </div>

            <div class="icon-item">
                <h2>6. Benjamin Graham</h2>
                <div class="icon-subtitle">"The Father of Value Investing"</div>
                <p>Author of "The Intelligent Investor" and mentor to Warren Buffett. Graham developed the fundamental principles of value investing.</p>
                <div class="struggle-box">
                    <strong>The Struggle:</strong> Lost nearly everything in the 1929 stock market crash, wiping out years of gains. His partnership declined 70% during the Great Depression. He faced depression and self-doubt, questioning his entire investment philosophy.
                </div>
                <p>Rather than abandoning investing, Graham systematized his approach, developing rigorous analytical methods to identify undervalued securities. He emphasized margin of safety and emotional discipline.</p>
                <div class="quote">"The investor's chief problem—and his worst enemy—is likely to be himself."</div>
                <p><strong>Legacy:</strong> Created the foundation of modern security analysis. His students include Warren Buffett and many other successful investors. His books remain essential reading 70+ years later.</p>
            </div>
            
            <div class="icon-item">
                <h2>7. Madam C.J. Walker</h2>
                <div class="icon-subtitle">"America's First Self-Made Female Millionaire"</div>
                <p>Born Sarah Breedlove to formerly enslaved parents in 1867, she became America's first self-made female millionaire through her haircare business.</p>
                <div class="struggle-box">
                    <strong>The Struggle:</strong> Orphaned at 7, married at 14 to escape abuse, widowed at 20 with a young daughter. Worked as a washerwoman earning $1.50 per day. Suffered from a scalp ailment that caused hair loss, facing social stigma and limited opportunities as a Black woman in the Jim Crow South.
                </div>
                <p>Walker developed her own haircare products, selling them door-to-door. She created a direct sales network of thousands of "Walker Agents," providing economic opportunities to Black women across America.</p>
                <div class="quote">"I had to make my own living and my own opportunity. Don't sit down and wait for the opportunities to come. Get up and make them."</div>
                <p><strong>Legacy:</strong> Built a thriving business empire worth over $1 million by 1919 (equivalent to $15+ million today). Pioneered modern direct marketing techniques and corporate training programs.</p>
            </div>
            
            <div class="ad-space">

            <div class="icon-item">
                <h2>8. George Soros</h2>
                <div class="icon-subtitle">"The Man Who Broke the Bank of England"</div>
                <p>Hedge fund manager and philanthropist who survived Nazi-occupied Hungary as a child and built one of the most successful investment careers in history.</p>
                <div class="struggle-box">
                    <strong>The Struggle:</strong> As a Jewish teenager, Soros lived under false papers during the Holocaust, narrowly escaping death. Arrived in England penniless after WWII, working menial jobs while attending university. His early investment ventures struggled, and establishing credibility as a foreigner in finance was difficult.
                </div>
                <p>Soros developed his theory of reflexivity—that market perceptions shape reality, which in turn influences perceptions. His philosophical approach to markets and willingness to make massive, bold bets defined his career.</p>
                <div class="quote">"It's not whether you're right or wrong that's important, but how much money you make when you're right and how much you lose when you're wrong."</div>
                <p><strong>Legacy:</strong> Made $1 billion in a single day shorting the British pound in 1992. Donated over $32 billion to philanthropic causes through his Open Society Foundations.</p>
            </div>
            
            <div class="icon-item">
                <h2>9. Peter Lynch</h2>
                <div class="icon-subtitle">"Invest in What You Know"</div>
                <p>Managed Fidelity Magellan Fund from 1977 to 1990, achieving an average annual return of 29.2%, making it the best-performing mutual fund in the world.</p>
                <div class="struggle-box">
                    <strong>The Struggle:</strong> Started as a caddy to pay for his college education. Lost his father at age 10, forcing his family into financial hardship. Early in his career, faced skepticism about his "simple" investment philosophy of investing in understandable businesses. Managing billions while maintaining performance created immense pressure.
                </div>
                <p>Lynch popularized the idea that average investors could beat Wall Street by investing in companies they understood from everyday life. He'd discover investment ideas at the mall, grocery store, or through his family's experiences.</p>
                <div class="quote">"Know what you own, and know why you own it."</div>
                <p><strong>Legacy:</strong> Turned Magellan from $18 million to $14 billion in assets. Proved that common sense and research could outperform complex strategies. His books democratized investing knowledge.</p>
            </div>
            
            <div class="icon-item">
                <h2>10. John Bogle</h2>
                <div class="icon-subtitle">"Champion of the Individual Investor"</div>
                <p>Founded Vanguard Group and created the first index mutual fund available to individual investors, revolutionizing investing for millions.</p>
                <div class="struggle-box">
                    <strong>The Struggle:</strong> Suffered a heart attack at age 31. Fired from his job at Wellington Management in 1974 after a merger he championed failed spectacularly. Starting Vanguard at age 45 with a radical idea (low-cost index funds) that the entire investment industry ridiculed and opposed. Faced constant legal challenges from competitors.
                </div>
                <p>Bogle persevered despite ridicule, creating the first index fund in 1976. Initially, it was considered "un-American" and "a formula for mediocrity." It raised only $11 million in its first offering, far below the $150 million target.</p>
                <div class="quote">"Don't look for the needle in the haystack. Just buy the haystack."</div>
                <p><strong>Legacy:</strong> Vanguard now manages over $7 trillion. His index fund innovation saved investors trillions in fees. Named one of the world's 100 most influential people. Proved that low-cost, passive investing beats most active management.</p>
