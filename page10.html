        <div class="main-content">
            <p style="font-size: 1.2rem; margin-bottom: 2rem;">Asset management companies oversee trillions of dollars on behalf of individuals, institutions, and governments. These financial giants shape global markets and influence economic policy worldwide. Here are the largest players.</p>
            
            <div class="company">
                <h2>1. BlackRock</h2>
                <div class="aum">Assets Under Management: ~$10 Trillion</div>
                <p><strong>Founded:</strong> 1988 by Larry Fink and seven partners</p>
                <p><strong>Headquarters:</strong> New York City, USA</p>
                <p>BlackRock is the world's largest asset manager, overseeing more money than the GDP of every country except the US and China. The firm manages assets for everyone from individual retirement savers to central banks.</p>
                <div class="highlight">
                    <strong>Key Innovation:</strong> Aladdin, BlackRock's risk management platform, analyzes $21+ trillion in assets and is used by competitors, creating unprecedented market influence and insight.
                </div>
                <p><strong>Notable Products:</strong> iShares ETFs (world's largest ETF provider), target-date retirement funds, institutional portfolio management</p>
                <p><strong>Impact:</strong> BlackRock's size gives it enormous corporate influence. As a major shareholder in thousands of companies, its voting decisions shape corporate governance globally.</p>
            </div>
            
            <div class="company">
                <h2>2. Vanguard Group</h2>
                <div class="aum">Assets Under Management: ~$8 Trillion</div>
                <p><strong>Founded:</strong> 1975 by John Bogle</p>
                <p><strong>Headquarters:</strong> Malvern, Pennsylvania, USA</p>
                <p>Vanguard pioneered index investing for individual investors, fundamentally democratizing wealth building. The firm is uniquely owned by its funds, which are owned by investors—meaning Vanguard is effectively owned by its clients.</p>
                <div class="highlight">
                    <strong>Philosophy:</strong> Minimize costs, maximize returns through passive index investing. Vanguard's average expense ratio is 0.08%—far below industry averages. This structure has saved investors hundreds of billions in fees.
                </div>
                <p><strong>Notable Products:</strong> Vanguard Total Stock Market Index Fund, Vanguard 500 Index Fund, Vanguard Total Bond Market Index Fund</p>
                <p><strong>Legacy:</strong> John Bogle's creation of the first index mutual fund (1976) was initially mocked but ultimately revolutionized investing, proving low-cost passive strategies beat most active management.</p>
