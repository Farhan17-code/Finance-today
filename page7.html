        <p>Understanding how banks work and their role in the economy</p>
    </div>

        <div class="main-content">
            <p style="font-size: 1.2rem; margin-bottom: 2rem;">Banks are the cornerstone of modern economies, facilitating everything from savings to international trade. Understanding how they work empowers you to make better financial decisions.</p>
            
            <div class="section">
                <h2>What Are Banks?</h2>
                <p>Banks are financial institutions licensed to accept deposits and make loans. They act as intermediaries between savers who have money and borrowers who need it, earning profit from the interest rate spread.</p>
                <div class="highlight-box">
                    <strong>Core Functions:</strong> Accepting deposits, providing loans, facilitating payments, offering financial services (credit cards, investments, insurance), safeguarding money, and creating credit in the economy.
                </div>
                <p>Modern banks are far more than vaults for storing cash. They're the circulatory system of the economy, moving money where it's needed to fuel growth and commerce.</p>
            </div>
            
            <div class="section">
                <h2>How Banks Make Money</h2>
                <p>Banks primarily profit from the difference between interest paid to depositors and interest charged to borrowers. This is called the net interest margin.</p>
                <p><strong>Example:</strong> A bank pays you 1% interest on your savings account but charges a mortgage borrower 5%. The 4% difference is their gross profit, minus operating costs.</p>
                <div class="highlight-box">
                    <strong>Additional Revenue Sources:</strong> Account fees (overdrafts, maintenance), credit card interest and fees, investment management fees, foreign exchange fees, ATM fees, loan origination fees.
                </div>
                <p>This is why banks offer "free" checking accounts—your deposits provide cheap capital they can lend at higher rates. They're essentially renting your money.</p>
            </div>
            
            <div class="ad-space">AD SPACE - 336x280 Rectangle</div>
            
            <div class="section">
                <h2>Fractional Reserve Banking</h2>
                <p>Banks don't keep all deposited money in vaults. They're only required to hold a fraction (the reserve requirement) and can lend the rest. This is called fractional reserve banking.</p>
                <p><strong>How It Works:</strong> If you deposit $1,000 and the reserve requirement is 10%, the bank must keep $100 and can lend $900. When that $900 is deposited elsewhere, that bank keeps $90 and lends $810, and so on.</p>
                <div class="highlight-box">
                    <strong>Money Multiplication:</strong> Through this process, your initial $1,000 deposit can eventually create roughly $10,000 in the money supply. This is how banks "create money" and expand the economy.
                </div>
                <p>This system works because not all depositors withdraw money simultaneously. However, if they do (a bank run), the system collapses—hence the importance of deposit insurance.</p>
            </div>
            
            <div class="section">
                <h2>Types of Banks</h2>
                <p><strong>Commercial Banks:</strong> The most common type, serving individuals and businesses with checking accounts, savings accounts, loans, and credit cards. Examples: Chase, Bank of America, Wells Fargo.</p>
                <p><strong>Investment Banks:</strong> Don't accept deposits from the public. They help companies raise capital through IPOs, facilitate mergers and acquisitions, and trade securities. Examples: Goldman Sachs, Morgan Stanley.</p>
                <p><strong>Credit Unions:</strong> Non-profit cooperatives owned by members, typically offering better rates and lower fees than commercial banks.</p>
                <p><strong>Central Banks:</strong> Government institutions that manage monetary policy, regulate commercial banks, and act as lender of last resort. Examples: Federal Reserve (US), European Central Bank.</p>
                <p><strong>Online Banks:</strong> Digital-only institutions with no physical branches, offering higher interest rates due to lower overhead costs.</p>
            </div>

            <div class="section">
                <h2>Bank Regulation and Safety</h2>
                <p>Banks are among the most regulated businesses because their failure can trigger economic catastrophe. Multiple layers of oversight exist to maintain stability.</p>
                <div class="highlight-box">
                    <strong>Key Regulations:</strong> Capital requirements (banks must maintain equity buffers), reserve requirements, stress tests, lending standards, consumer protection laws, anti-money laundering rules.
                </div>
                <p><strong>FDIC Insurance (US):</strong> Deposits up to $250,000 per account are insured by the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation. If a bank fails, you get your money back (up to the limit).</p>
                <p>This insurance prevents bank runs—when depositors panic and withdraw money simultaneously, causing solvent banks to fail due to liquidity issues.</p>
                <p>After the 2008 financial crisis, regulations became stricter. The Dodd-Frank Act imposed additional requirements on large banks to prevent "too big to fail" scenarios.</p>
            </div>
            
            <div class="section">
                <h2>The Role of Central Banks</h2>
                <p>Central banks (like the Federal Reserve in the US) control monetary policy, influencing the entire banking system and economy.</p>
                <p><strong>Key Tools:</strong></p>
                <p><strong>1. Interest Rates:</strong> By raising or lowering the federal funds rate (what banks charge each other for overnight loans), central banks influence all other interest rates in the economy.</p>
                <p><strong>2. Reserve Requirements:</strong> Changing how much banks must hold in reserves affects how much they can lend.</p>
                <p><strong>3. Open Market Operations:</strong> Buying or selling government bonds to inject or remove money from the banking system.</p>
                <div class="highlight-box">
                    <strong>Economic Impact:</strong> When central banks lower interest rates, borrowing becomes cheaper, stimulating spending and investment. Higher rates slow borrowing to combat inflation.
                </div>
                <p>Central banks also act as "lenders of last resort," providing emergency funding to solvent banks facing temporary liquidity crises, preventing contagion.</p>
            </div>
            
            <div class="ad-space">AD SPACE - 336x280 Rectangle</div>
            
            <div class="section">
                <h2>How Loans Work</h2>
                <p>When banks make loans, they're creating money—literally adding to the money supply through accounting entries.</p>
                <p><strong>The Process:</strong> You apply for a $200,000 mortgage. After approval, the bank doesn't hand you physical cash. They credit your account $200,000, increasing the money supply. You transfer it to the seller, who deposits it in their bank, which can now lend 90% of it to someone else.</p>
                <div class="highlight-box">
                    <strong>Loan Assessment:</strong> Banks evaluate creditworthiness through credit scores, income verification, debt-to-income ratios, employment history, and collateral value. They're assessing: "Will you repay, and can we recover our money if you don't?"
                </div>
                <p>Interest rates vary based on risk. Lower credit scores mean higher rates because the probability of default increases.</p>
            </div>
            
            <div class="section">
                <h2>Digital Banking Revolution</h2>
                <p>Technology is transforming banking faster than any time since the ATM's invention in the 1960s.</p>
                <p><strong>Mobile Banking:</strong> Depositing checks by photo, transferring money instantly, and managing accounts from smartphones have become standard expectations.</p>
                <p><strong>Fintech Competition:</strong> Companies like PayPal, Venmo, Square, and Robinhood offer banking services without being traditional banks, increasing competition and innovation.</p>
                <p><strong>Blockchain and Cryptocurrencies:</strong> Decentralized finance (DeFi) threatens traditional banking by enabling peer-to-peer lending and transactions without intermediaries.</p>
                <div class="highlight-box">
                    <strong>Future Trends:</strong> Central bank digital currencies (CBDCs), AI-powered loan approvals, biometric security, open banking APIs allowing data sharing between institutions, and increased automation of services.
                </div>
            </div>
            
            <div class="section">
                <h2>International Banking</h2>
                <p>Global banks facilitate international trade and investment, managing currency exchange, foreign payments, and cross-border lending.</p>
                <p><strong>SWIFT System:</strong> The Society for Worldwide Interbank Financial Telecommunication coordinates most international bank transfers, sending secure messages between institutions worldwide.</p>
                <p><strong>Correspondent Banking:</strong> Banks in different countries maintain accounts with each other to facilitate international transactions. Your bank doesn't have offices worldwide—it partners with banks that do.</p>
                <p>International banking faces unique challenges: currency risk, different regulations, political instability, and higher transaction costs.</p>
            </div>
            
            <div class="ad-space">AD SPACE - 728x90 Banner</div>
            
            <div class="section">
                <h2>Banking and Economic Stability</h2>
                <p>Healthy banking systems are essential for economic growth. They channel savings into productive investments, facilitate commerce, and provide liquidity.</p>
                <p>However, banking crises can devastate economies. The 2008 financial crisis showed how interconnected banks can spread problems globally—when one major bank fails, others suffer due to interbank lending and shared exposures.</p>
                <div class="highlight-box">
                    <strong>Lessons Learned:</strong> Adequate capital buffers are crucial, excessive leverage is dangerous, complex financial products increase systemic risk, and regulatory oversight must keep pace with financial innovation.
                </div>
                <p>Strong banking systems require trust. When people lose confidence in banks, they withdraw deposits, creating self-fulfilling prophecies of failure even for healthy institutions.</p>
