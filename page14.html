        <h1>🌍 Global Economy Basics</h1>
        <p>Understanding how the world economy works</p>
    </div>
    
    <div class="ad-space">AD SPACE - 728x90 Banner</div>
    
    <div class="container">
        <div class="main-content">
            <p style="font-size: 1.2rem; margin-bottom: 2rem;">The global economy is an interconnected system where countries trade goods, services, and capital. What happens in one nation ripples worldwide. Understanding these connections helps you make sense of economic news and its impact on your finances.</p>
            
            <div class="section">
                <h2>What Is the Global Economy?</h2>
                <p>The global economy encompasses all economic activities worldwide—production, consumption, trade, and investment—connected through international markets, communication, and financial systems.</p>
                <div class="highlight">
                    <strong>Interconnection:</strong> Modern economies are deeply integrated. Your smartphone contains parts from dozens of countries. Your retirement account owns companies operating globally. Economic shocks anywhere affect everywhere.
                </div>
                <p>Globalization has accelerated dramatically since WWII, driven by technology, reduced trade barriers, and international institutions promoting commerce.</p>
            </div>
            
            <div class="section">
                <h2>International Trade</h2>
                <p>Countries trade because specialization increases efficiency. Nations produce what they're relatively good at and trade for other goods—everyone benefits.</p>
                <p><strong>Comparative Advantage:</strong> Even if one country is better at everything, both benefit from trade if each specializes in what they're relatively best at. This principle underlies all international commerce.</p>
                <div class="highlight">
                    <strong>Example:</strong> Japan excels at manufacturing electronics. Brazil excels at agriculture. Trading Japanese electronics for Brazilian coffee makes both countries wealthier than if each tried producing everything themselves.
                </div>
                <p><strong>Trade Deficits and Surpluses:</strong> Trade deficits (importing more than exporting) aren't inherently bad—they mean consumers access cheaper goods. Surpluses aren't inherently good—they may indicate insufficient domestic consumption.</p>
                <p><strong>Trade Agreements:</strong> Treaties like NAFTA/USMCA, EU, and others reduce tariffs and barriers, facilitating commerce. They're controversial—boosting overall wealth but disrupting specific industries and workers.</p>
            </div>

            <div class="section">
                <h2>Exchange Rates and Currencies</h2>
                <p>Exchange rates determine how much one currency is worth in another. They fluctuate based on supply and demand, affecting trade, investment, and purchasing power.</p>
                <p><strong>Floating vs Fixed Rates:</strong> Most major currencies float freely, determined by markets. Some countries fix rates to other currencies (often the dollar) or manage them within ranges.</p>
                <div class="highlight">
                    <strong>Impact:</strong> A strong dollar makes US exports expensive (bad for exporters) but imports cheap (good for consumers). A weak dollar has opposite effects.
                </div>
                <p><strong>Carry Trade:</strong> Investors borrow in low-interest currencies and invest in high-interest ones, profiting from the difference. This can amplify currency movements.</p>
                <p><strong>Currency Crises:</strong> Rapid devaluation can devastate economies, as seen in Asia (1997), Russia (1998), and Argentina (2001). Countries with dollar-denominated debt are especially vulnerable.</p>
            </div>
            
            <div class="section">
                <h2>Global Financial Markets</h2>
                <p>Capital flows globally, seeking the best risk-adjusted returns. A company in India can borrow from Japanese banks and sell stocks to American investors.</p>
                <p><strong>Bond Markets:</strong> Governments and corporations issue bonds internationally. US Treasuries are the global safe haven—what the world buys during crises.</p>
                <p><strong>Stock Markets:</strong> Companies list on multiple exchanges. What happens on Wall Street affects Tokyo, London, and Frankfurt, and vice versa.</p>
                <div class="highlight">
                    <strong>Contagion:</strong> Financial crises spread rapidly across borders. The 2008 US housing crisis became a global financial meltdown because banks worldwide held toxic American mortgage securities.
                </div>
                <p><strong>Emerging Markets:</strong> Developing countries offer higher growth potential but greater risk. Political instability, weaker institutions, and volatile currencies can cause dramatic swings.</p>
            </div>
            
            <div class="section">
                <h2>Global Institutions</h2>
                <p><strong>International Monetary Fund (IMF):</strong> Provides emergency loans to countries facing financial crises. Often requires austerity measures and reforms as conditions, which is controversial.</p>
                <p><strong>World Bank:</strong> Funds development projects in poor countries—infrastructure, education, healthcare. Aims to reduce poverty and promote sustainable development.</p>
                <p><strong>World Trade Organization (WTO):</strong> Mediates trade disputes and promotes free trade. Sets rules for international commerce and resolves conflicts between member nations.</p>
                <div class="highlight">
                    <strong>G7 and G20:</strong> Groups of major economies coordinating economic policies. They address global challenges like financial regulation, climate change, and pandemic response.
                </div>
                <p><strong>Central Bank Cooperation:</strong> The Federal Reserve, European Central Bank, Bank of Japan, and others coordinate during crises, providing liquidity and stabilizing markets.</p>
            </div>
            
            <div class="ad-space">AD SPACE - 728x90 Banner</div>
            
            <div class="section">
                <h2>Economic Indicators</h2>
                <p><strong>Gross Domestic Product (GDP):</strong> Total value of goods and services produced. The primary measure of economic size and growth. US GDP is about $25 trillion; China is second at $18 trillion.</p>
                <p><strong>Unemployment Rate:</strong> Percentage of workforce actively seeking but unable to find jobs. Low unemployment indicates healthy economy but can signal inflation pressure.</p>
                <p><strong>Inflation:</strong> Rising prices eroding purchasing power. Central banks target 2% as healthy. Too high destroys value; too low can signal depression.</p>
                <p><strong>Interest Rates:</strong> Cost of borrowing money. Central banks raise rates to cool inflation, lower them to stimulate growth.</p>
                <div class="highlight">
                    <strong>Consumer Confidence:</strong> How optimistic people feel about the economy. High confidence drives spending and investment; low confidence causes recession.
                </div>
                <p><strong>Purchasing Managers' Index (PMI):</strong> Survey measuring manufacturing and service sector health. Above 50 indicates expansion; below 50 signals contraction.</p>
            </div>
            
            <div class="section">
                <h2>Economic Cycles</h2>
                <p>Economies expand and contract in cycles. Understanding these patterns helps predict trends and make better financial decisions.</p>
                <p><strong>Expansion:</strong> Economic growth, rising employment, increasing incomes, strong consumer and business confidence. Can last years or decades.</p>
                <p><strong>Peak:</strong> Maximum growth before downturn. Often characterized by inflation pressure, overvalued assets, and excessive optimism.</p>
                <p><strong>Contraction (Recession):</strong> Declining GDP, rising unemployment, falling incomes. Officially defined as two consecutive quarters of negative GDP growth.</p>
                <p><strong>Trough:</strong> Lowest point before recovery begins. High unemployment, pessimism, but also opportunities for contrarian investors.</p>
                <div class="highlight">
                    <strong>Historical Pattern:</strong> Recessions are inevitable but temporary. Every recession in history has been followed by recovery and new highs. Timing is unpredictable—prepare for downturns but don't try timing them.
                </div>
            </div>
            
            <div class="ad-space">AD SPACE - 336x280 Rectangle</div>
            
            <div class="section">
                <h2>Globalization's Impact</h2>
                <p><strong>Benefits:</strong> Lower prices for consumers, increased economic growth, poverty reduction in developing nations, technology and knowledge sharing, greater product variety.</p>
                <p><strong>Challenges:</strong> Job losses in high-wage countries as manufacturing shifts to low-wage nations, environmental degradation from increased production and shipping, cultural homogenization, increased inequality within countries.</p>
                <div class="highlight">
                    <strong>The Debate:</strong> Globalization creates overall wealth but distributes it unevenly. Winners include consumers and corporations; losers include displaced workers in specific industries. Political tensions arise from this uneven distribution.
                </div>
                <p><strong>Reshoring Trends:</strong> Some manufacturing is returning to developed countries due to automation, supply chain concerns, and geopolitical tensions.</p>
            </div>
            
            <div class="section">
                <h2>Emerging Economic Powers</h2>
                <p><strong>China:</strong> World's second-largest economy, massive manufacturing base, growing consumer market, but faces challenges from aging population, debt levels, and political tensions with West.</p>
                <p><strong>India:</strong> World's most populous nation with young demographics, growing tech sector, but infrastructure gaps and bureaucracy slow development.</p>
                <p><strong>BRICS Nations:</strong> Brazil, Russia, India, China, South Africa represent major emerging economies collectively challenging Western economic dominance.</p>
                <div class="highlight">
                    <strong>Shift in Power:</strong> Economic power is shifting from West to East. By some measures, Asia already produces more than Europe and North America combined.
                </div>
            </div>
            
            <div class="section">
                <h2>Global Challenges</h2>
                <p><strong>Climate Change:</strong> Economic impacts include infrastructure damage, agricultural disruption, migration pressures. Transitioning to clean energy requires trillions in investment.</p>
                <p><strong>Aging Populations:</strong> Developed nations face shrinking workforces supporting growing retiree populations. This strains pension systems and slows growth.</p>
                <p><strong>Inequality:</strong> Wealth concentration increases both within and between nations. Top 1% own disproportionate wealth, creating social and political tensions.</p>
                <p><strong>Debt Levels:</strong> Government, corporate, and household debt at historic highs. Future crises could be triggered by inability to service these obligations.</p>
                <p><strong>Technological Disruption:</strong> Automation and AI threaten millions of jobs while creating new opportunities. Managing this transition is a major challenge.</p>
