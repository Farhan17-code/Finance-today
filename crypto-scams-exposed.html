        <p>Protect yourself from cryptocurrency fraud</p>
    </div>

    <div class="container">
        <div class="main-content">
            <p style="font-size: 1.2rem; color: #555; margin-bottom: 2rem;">Cryptocurrency's decentralized nature and lack of regulation make it a prime target for scammers. Billions are lost annually to crypto fraud. Here are the most common scams and how to avoid them.</p>
            
            <div class="scam-item">
                <h2>1. Fake ICOs (Initial Coin Offerings)</h2>
                <p>Scammers create fake cryptocurrency projects with impressive websites, whitepapers, and teams. They promise revolutionary technology and massive returns, then disappear after raising funds.</p>
                <div class="warning-box">
                    <strong>Red Flags:</strong> Anonymous team members, unrealistic promises (10x-100x returns guaranteed), pressure to invest quickly, poorly written whitepaper, no working product or code repository.
                </div>
                <p><strong>Famous Example:</strong> Pincoin and iFan scammed 32,000 investors out of $660 million in 2018. Both vanished overnight.</p>
                <div class="protection-tip">
                    <strong>Protection:</strong> Research team members thoroughly. Verify their LinkedIn profiles and past work. Check if code is open-source on GitHub. Never invest based on FOMO (fear of missing out).
                </div>
            </div>
            
            <div class="scam-item">
                <h2>2. Ponzi Schemes</h2>
                <p>These pay early investors with money from new investors rather than from actual profits. They collapse when recruitment slows, leaving most participants with losses.</p>
                <p>Crypto Ponzis often disguise themselves as "cloud mining" operations, "AI trading bots," or "staking pools" promising unrealistic returns like 1% daily.</p>
                <div class="warning-box">
                    <strong>Red Flags:</strong> Guaranteed high returns (20%+ monthly), emphasis on recruiting others, vague explanations of how profits are generated, withdrawal problems, pressure to reinvest earnings.
                </div>
                <p><strong>Famous Example:</strong> BitConnect promised 40% monthly returns through a "trading bot." It collapsed in 2018, causing $3.5 billion in losses.</p>
                <div class="protection-tip">
                    <strong>Protection:</strong> If returns seem too good to be true, they are. Legitimate investments carry risk. Any guarantee of high returns is a massive red flag.
                </div>
            </div>

            <div class="scam-item">
                <h2>3. Phishing Attacks</h2>
                <p>Scammers create fake websites, emails, or apps that look identical to legitimate crypto exchanges or wallets. When you enter your login credentials or seed phrase, they steal your funds.</p>
                <div class="warning-box">
                    <strong>Red Flags:</strong> Slight misspellings in URLs (Coinbas.com instead of Coinbase.com), unsolicited emails asking you to "verify your account," messages about winning crypto that require clicking a link.
                </div>
                <p>Phishing is the #1 way hackers steal cryptocurrency. Even one character difference in a URL can lead to a fake site that steals your information.</p>
                <div class="protection-tip">
                    <strong>Protection:</strong> Always type URLs directly. Enable 2FA. Never share your seed phrase with anyone—legitimate companies NEVER ask for it. Bookmark legitimate sites.
                </div>
            </div>
            
            <div class="scam-item">
                <h2>4. Pump and Dump Schemes</h2>
                <p>Groups artificially inflate a cryptocurrency's price through coordinated buying and hype, then sell at the peak, leaving others with worthless tokens.</p>
                <p>These operate through Telegram groups, Discord servers, or social media, with admins promising members insider information about which coin will "moon."</p>
                <div class="warning-box">
                    <strong>Red Flags:</strong> Groups promoting specific low-cap coins, promises of "guaranteed" gains, emphasis on buying quickly before others, suspicious price spikes with no news.
                </div>
                <p>The organizers buy first, pump the price through hype, then dump on unsuspecting followers who bought at inflated prices.</p>
                <div class="protection-tip">
                    <strong>Protection:</strong> Avoid "pump" groups entirely. Make investment decisions based on research, not hype. Be suspicious of coordinated promotions on social media.
                </div>
            </div>
            
            <div class="ad-space">AD SPACE - 728x90 Banner</div>
            
            <div class="scam-item">
                <h2>5. Fake Giveaways</h2>
                <p>Scammers impersonate celebrities or crypto companies, claiming they'll double any crypto sent to a specific address. This is always a scam.</p>
                <div class="warning-box">
                    <strong>Red Flags:</strong> Anyone asking you to send crypto to "verify" your address, promises to send back more than you sent, impersonator accounts with similar names/logos, urgency ("limited time offer").
                </div>
                <p><strong>Famous Example:</strong> Scammers hacked verified Twitter accounts (including Elon Musk, Bill Gates, Barack Obama) in 2020, posting fake Bitcoin giveaways and stealing over $100,000 in hours.</p>
                <div class="protection-tip">
                    <strong>Protection:</strong> No legitimate person or company will ask you to send crypto first. Real giveaways never require payment. Verify accounts carefully before trusting.
                </div>
            </div>
            
            <div class="scam-item">
                <h2>6. Rug Pulls</h2>
                <p>Developers create a token, hype it up, attract investors, then drain all liquidity and abandon the project. This happens most frequently with DeFi (decentralized finance) tokens.</p>
                <div class="warning-box">
                    <strong>Red Flags:</strong> Anonymous developers, unlocked liquidity that can be withdrawn anytime, no audit of smart contract code, heavy marketing with little substance, centralized token ownership.
                </div>
                <p><strong>Famous Example:</strong> Squid Game token surged 45,000% in days, then developers withdrew all liquidity. Investors couldn't sell, losing millions instantly.</p>
                <div class="protection-tip">
                    <strong>Protection:</strong> Check if liquidity is locked. Verify smart contracts are audited by reputable firms. Avoid tokens where developers hold large percentages.
                </div>
            </div>
            
            <div class="ad-space">AD SPACE - 336x280 Rectangle</div>
            
            <div class="scam-item">
                <h2>7. Fake Exchanges and Wallets</h2>
                <p>Fraudsters create fake cryptocurrency exchanges or wallet apps that look professional but exist solely to steal deposits.</p>
                <div class="warning-box">
                    <strong>Red Flags:</strong> Unrealistic bonuses for signing up, apps not available on official app stores, poor reviews or no reviews, requests for excessive personal information.
                </div>
                <p>These fake platforms may let you deposit and even show fake profits, but when you try to withdraw, you'll find the funds are gone or withdrawal requires additional fees that lead nowhere.</p>
                <div class="protection-tip">
                    <strong>Protection:</strong> Only use well-established exchanges (Coinbase, Binance, Kraken). Download wallet apps only from official websites. Read reviews carefully. Start with small amounts to test.
                </div>
            </div>
            
            <div class="scam-item">
                <h2>8. Romance Scams (Pig Butchering)</h2>
                <p>Scammers build online romantic relationships, then gradually introduce cryptocurrency investment opportunities, convincing victims to invest in fake platforms.</p>
                <div class="warning-box">
                    <strong>Red Flags:</strong> Quick declarations of love, never meeting in person, gradual introduction of investment topics, showing fake profits to build trust, requests to teach you about crypto investing.
                </div>
                <p>Victims often lose life savings. The "investment platform" shows growing profits, encouraging more deposits, but withdrawals are impossible.</p>
                <div class="protection-tip">
                    <strong>Protection:</strong> Never mix romance and investing. Be skeptical of online relationships that quickly turn to money. Never send cryptocurrency to someone you haven't met.
                </div>
            </div>

                <h2 style="color: #10b981; margin-bottom: 1rem;">General Protection Principles</h2>
                <ul style="margin-left: 2rem; line-height: 2;">
                    <li>If it sounds too good to be true, it absolutely is</li>
                    <li>Never share your seed phrase or private keys</li>
                    <li>Use hardware wallets for large amounts</li>
                    <li>Enable all available security features (2FA, whitelisting)</li>
                    <li>Research extensively before investing</li>
                    <li>Don't invest more than you can afford to lose</li>
                    <li>Be skeptical of unsolicited investment advice</li>
                    <li>Verify information through multiple sources</li>
